This is a list of all projects assigned to help develop my knowledge of data algorithms and structures
ASSIGNMENTS 3,4, and 5 showcase the use of various data types using structures like linked lists , Binary Search Trees, Graphs  and Hash Tables 
Also was able to implement varying algorithms like heapification , prims algorithm and using heap sorts to find the minimum or maximum in a maximum priority queue
